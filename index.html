            Fullstack Developer with experience in user authentication, database management, and Javascript.
            I graduated from Whitworth University in 2015 with a B.S. in Health Science and shortly after started
            teaching myself to code. After a couple years of doing other work I decided that I wanted to make a
            career out of coding. After some research I ended up choosing the UW coding camp and finished with my
            certification in auguest 2019</p>
        <p>In my spare time I enjoy video games with a special interest in fighting games and strategy games. I also
            like to dance and used to TA for latin, swing, and ballroom dance classes.</p>
